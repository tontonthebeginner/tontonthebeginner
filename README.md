Hey, I'm quite new to coding and programming. I mainly dabble in python and java but i have a tiny bit of knowledge on HTML and CSS.
Coding is just a hobby of mine that I would like to advance and learn more in. 
I have trouble understanding some concepts in all of the programming languages I listed but I'm fairly okay in it but I am very open to any forms of help/assistance.
